Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ping Identity Self-Service Account Manager (SSAM) is a Java web application
that enables users to perform their own account registration, profile updates,
and password changes.  The SSAM application works with account data and user
profiles which are stored in the Ping Identity Directory Server.

SSAM can be customized for branding, look and feel, and can be used as the
starting point for extensions and custom application development.

SSAM can provide its own user authentication (login) service, but can also be
deployed with authentication delegated to a PingFederate server.
